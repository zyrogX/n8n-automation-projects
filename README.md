# n8n Automation Projects

This repository contains automation workflows I built using **n8n** for various AI and automation tasks.  
Each workflow is exported as a `.json` file, which can be directly imported into any n8n instance.

## ðŸš€ Workflows Included

### 1. Gmail Responder (`Gmail_responder.json`)
- Automatically responds to incoming Gmail messages based on predefined rules.  
- Can be extended with AI for smart replies.

### 2. RAG using n8n (`RAG_using_n8n.json`)
- A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.  
- Upload a PDF, vectorize the content, store it in Pinecone, and query with LLMs for contextual Q&A.

### 3. File Upload for RAG (`file_upload_RAG.json`)
- Helper workflow for uploading and processing PDF files for RAG pipelines.  
- Handles file input and sends processed chunks to Pinecone.

### 4. Inventory Handler (`inventory_handler.json`)
- Automates inventory updates and tracking.  
- Can be integrated with e-commerce platforms or databases.
